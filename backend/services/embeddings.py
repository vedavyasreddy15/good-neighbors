# ─── What this file does ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Talks to Google Gemini to convert text into embeddings (lists of numbers).
#
# Why do we convert text to numbers?
#   Computers can't compare "jazz musician in South Philly" to "live music gig
#   in Rittenhouse" and know they're related. But if you convert both to 1536
#   numbers, you can measure how close they are mathematically. That distance
#   IS the similarity score. The model has learned from billions of texts what
#   words and concepts are related to each other.
#
# We build a single descriptive sentence from each profile/gig,
# then ask Gemini to embed it. One clean sentence works better than
# dumping raw JSON at the model.
